# SVG Logo Generator App

## Description

This tiny app uses the command line in node to help developers create a simple logo for their projects. Sometimes you cannot afford a graphic designer at the beginning of your project, but you still need a simple, professional logo to attach to your documents. This app can help.

You must have node.js installed on your environment to use this app. The node modules that are required for this project are included in a package found in the repository. You must run `npm i` to install the node modules on your environment to run the app.

Once you have installed the node modules you need, simply open the index in your terminal and execute the `node .` or `node index.js` command to begin the application.
